## About this project ðŸš€
This project intends to be a didactic tool to teach spectroscopy and chemometrics in the context of fermentation technology. During my studies, I often felt that many courses were theory-based only due to the rather limited access to real-world data. For this reason, I have decided to distribute the laboratory data I generated during my studies to provide a better learning experience for the upcomming generations of students. 

Although the main goal of this project is to distribute the data, I have also provided a set of functions that can be used to  investigate the data and build partial least squares (PLS) models to predict the glucose concentration.

These functions can be used as a starting point for the, but more advanced users are encouradged to explore other packages to play with this data (e.g., ```scikit-learn```, or ```scipy```). 

## About the data ðŸ“ˆ
This project provides two datasets (a training and a validation set). Both data sets were recorded at the Technical University of Denmar, Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, at the PROSYS center during 2019. More information about the dataset can be found in the following publication [Transforming data to information: A parallel hybrid model for real-time state estimation in lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.27586)

### The training set
The training set contains the spectra of 20 semi-synthetic samples and their reference glucose concentration measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The spectra were measured using attenuated total refractance mid infrared (ATR-MIR) spectroscopy.

### Validation set
The validation contains spectra measured every minute during a lignocellulose to ethanol fermentation. These spectra were collected in _real-time_ using the same ATR-MIR instrument, connected to a flow-cell. Moreover, the extracellular concentrations of glucose, xylose, ethanol, furfural and acetic acid were also measured every hour using HPLC.  

## Installation ðŸ’»
### Dependencies
This project is build targetting Python >= 3.7, in order to be compatible with the python distribution in Google Colab.

### User installation ```pip```

```
pip install -U dtuprosys
```

## Quick start
A complete example of can be found in the ```example.ipynb```. The data can be accessed using as follows:

```
from dtuprosys.datasets import load_train_data, load_fermentation_data

```
to access the training data

```
train_spectra, train_hplc = load_train_data()
```
to access the validation data:
```
fermentation_spectra, fermentation_hplc = load_fermentation_data()
``` 

Additional functions, include:
- Common preprocessing steps for spectral data
- Plotting tools for spectra, and time series data
- Functions to assist modeling spectral data and model training
